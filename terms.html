      <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
      <h2>Conditions By Attending Or Participating in an interview</h2>
      <p>As a registered candidate of TRS (Total Recruitment Solutions) I agree that I have been notified and introduced
        to this position at this company by TRS and/or their affiliates. I also agree that if I participate in an
        interview or I am made an offer and take this offer to my current employer and receive a counter offer by my
        current employer the full placement fee will be payable by me or my current employer since this has led to a
        counter offer. I agree that if any CCMA case arises by this introduction/interview, then TRS and/or their
        affiliates will not be held liable or will not be required to attend, represent or be liable for any CCMA
        findings, fees or penalties between myself and the company I have been placed/introduced to here. Furthermore, I
        am under no obligation to accept any offer obtained by TRS. However, should TRS obtain an offer of employment
        that
        I accept in writing/digitally and should I thereafter at any time renege on said acceptance (that is change my
        mind about the acceptance of the offer) for any reason whatsoever I will be liable to TRS for any damages
        arising
        out of the said placement and/or indeed for any damages or loss whatsoever caused or suffered by such reneging.
        The term “renege” and/or “reneging” shall mean including but not limited to the failure to commence employment
        after the acceptance of the/an offer of employment and/or the commencement of employment but failure to continue
        such employment for a period not exceeding 3(three) calendar months. These damages will be based on the
        seniority
        of the position and the annual cost to company of the position held (should I still be employed) or previously
        had
        (I left my employment) and will be calculated at 20% thereof. R (Rand Annual Cost to Company) x 20% = R (Rand
        Damages) excl. vat and these damages will be deemed to be liquid damages. Such damages arising out of the said
        placement and/or indeed for any damages or loss whatsoever caused or suffered by such reneging is apart and
        separate from any claim the client may have against me for reneging on the offer of employment. I will also be
        liable to TRS for its legal costs on the attorney and client scale, including costs of any tracers and
        collections
        commission. TRS and I hereby consent to the jurisdiction of the magistrate's court to adjudicate any dispute
        arising from this contract.*</p>
